## The quickest start

Any valid HTML is already a block.

Got some HTML? Congratulations, you have a block. You can stop here if you like.

Do you want your block to interact with the application using it? Read on.

## Almost-as-quick start

Blocks are web components. We suggest writing them using React, a ready-made framework for writing web components. If you need it, here’s an intro to React.

Blocks can be sent data by the apps using them. Blocks can tell apps what types of data they take. We suggest writing blocks in TypeScript, which helps describe types.

We’ve provided a template to help you get started - here’s how to use it.

### Install

Clone this repo
Run yarn new:block yourblockname
Switch to your new folder: cd packages/hash/blocks/yourblockname
Run yarn install && yarn start
Open http://localhost:9090 in your browser. You should see ‘Hello World!’

### Code

Edit App.tsx to change the behavior of your block.

The AppProps type describes what data your block accepts - the names and types of properties that embedding applications should pass to your block. You can pass in dummy data for testing in webpack-dev-renderer.tsx.

Embedding applications may also pass an update function, an entityId and an entityTypeId as properties to your block - these are the ids identifying your block data in the app. Call update with any new data you want the app to set for your block - it should match the data types you have defined in AppProps.

See other blocks in packages/hash/blocks/ for examples.

### Build

Once you’ve finished writing your block, run yarn build.

This will produce a compiled version of your code in the dist folder, along with metadata files describing your block, and the data it accepts (its schema).

You now have a block package that you can provide to apps to use, by uploading it to the block catalog at blockprotocol.org (coming soon!)

You can write your block in regular JavaScript using the method described above - just rename your app to App.jsx, remove the types, and get coding - but the block schema will not be automatically generated as part of the build process.

You can write your own block schema manually, giving the type of props your App component accepts in JSON Schema format. Run yarn build in any existing block folder in the repo to generate an example block-schema.json
